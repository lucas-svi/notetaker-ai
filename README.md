## 🌐 How to Access the Website
- We decided to host the website on Lucas' personal website, https://svirsky.dev/apps/notetaker-ai, since InfinityFree was giving us issues with the free usage quota.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Download or clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucas-svi/notetaker-ai.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   - Double-click the file to open it.
   - Or, copy the full file path and paste it into your browser’s address bar.
  
## For Mobile

1. **Make Necessary Adjustments**
   
  Change IP address to your IP address in mobile/api.js
  
  baseURL: "http://    **IP**    /notetaker-ai/backend/index.php"
  
  While here, you can also change the base url if your folder structure looks different.
  If you do this, also go to backend/index.php and update $at_start in line to be the correct number.
  Currently it is set to 3 for the amount of arguments after localhost: /notetaker-ai/backend/index.php
  
2. **Run Backend Setup**

   This setup is next in the README

3. **Run Mobile Frontend**

   Run
   ```bash
   cd frontend/mobile
   npm i
   npm run android
   ```
   while android studio is open

## Database Setup
1. Make sure you have XAMPP downloaded.
2. Run Apache and MySQL through XAMPP.
3. Navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin.
4. Create the database called 'app_db'.
5. Create the users table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
email VARCHAR(50),
password VARCHAR(255)
);
```

6. Create the notes table

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
username VARCHAR(50),
note TEXT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
