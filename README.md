## 🚀 About

Notetaker AI is a web app that helps users take notes using AI. It transcribes lectures, organizes notes, and creates flashcards.

## 🌐 How to Access the Website
- We decided to host the website on Lucas' personal website, https://svirsky.dev/apps/notetaker-ai, since InfinityFree was giving us issues with the free usage quota.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Download or clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucas-svi/notetaker-ai.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   - Double-click the file to open it.
   - Or, copy the full file path and paste it into your browser’s address bar.
3. **Email fzamore@wesleyan.edu for the gemini API key**
   - Create a new file named api_key and place it in the backend directory i.e. /notetake-ai/backend/api_key.php
   - Declare $api_key = "The gemini api key here"
   - That's it!
## For Mobile

1. **Make Necessary Adjustments**
   
  Change IP address to your IP address in mobile/api.js
  
  baseURL: "http://    **IP**    /notetaker-ai/backend/index.php"
  
  While here, you can also change the base url if your folder structure looks different.
  If you do this, also go to backend/index.php and update $at_start in line to be the correct number.
  Currently it is set to 3 for the amount of arguments after localhost: /notetaker-ai/backend/index.php
  
2. **Run Backend Setup**

   This setup is next in the README

3. **Run Mobile Frontend**

   Run
   ```bash
   cd frontend/mobile
   npm i
   npm run android
   ```
   while android studio is open

## Composer Setup
1. Run `brew install composer` if you do not have composer already installed.
2. Run from backend folder `composer install` to install the dependencies.

## Running unit tests
1. Make sure you're in the backend folder.
2. Run `php vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the tests.

## How we used AI for Testing - Problem 2

We used AI in a couple of ways to help us in our testing.

1. Test Ideation
We asked Cursor, an AI powered code editor, to look at our UserModel and UserController, and let us know what kinds of unit tests would be effective for our model. It came up with tests similar to those required by the homework assignment. Cursor was also helpful in guiding us through how to set up and install PHPUnit Tests.
2. Test Writing
We used ChatGPT to help design a unit test for us. As none of us have used PHPUnit before, AI was a way to create code for tests quickly and learn the proper structure, which we then carried over to the future tests. ChatGPT also then asked us if we needed help running these tests, outside of just coding them, which helped get our testing process underway.
3. More specifically, we used generative AI to extend our existing UserApiTest.php by adding a missing DELETE endpoint test case. Using an AI tool, we prompted it to generate a PHPUnit test for user deletion. This allowed us to cover CRUD operations more comprehensively.

**AI-Generated Test Case:**
/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  DELETE /user/delete
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/**
 * @depends testPost_CreateUser
 */
public function testDelete_User(array $creds): void
{
    $r = $this->http->post('user/delete', [
        'form_params' => [
            'username' => $creds['username'],
        ],
    ]);

    $this->assertSame(
        200,
        $r->getStatusCode(),
        'Expected 200 OK from /user/delete'
    );
}

**How to Reproduce**
1)Open a generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT).
2)Use the prompt: "Extend this PHPUnit test suite to include DELETE user functionality."
3)Integrate the AI-generated test case into UserApiTest.php.
4)Run the test suite: phpunit UserApiTest.php

## New Features/Enhancments

We introduced an ELO-based quiz ranking system that allows users to generate quizzes directly from their notes. To showcase knowledge and engagement, we added a public leaderboard where users are ranked by their quiz performance—those with more correct answers climb higher on the board.

We also extended the DVC model to power an AI-driven note enhancement feature. This lets users customize their notes' structure, offering options for bullet points, summaries, expanded details, or a general reformat for better organization.

Finally, we launched a textbook feature that enables users to categorize their notes by class. A bubble icon for each textbook allows quick filtering, making it easy to access class-specific notes.


## Database Setup
1. Make sure you have XAMPP downloaded.
2. Run Apache and MySQL through XAMPP.
3. Navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin.
4. Create the database called 'app_db'.
5. Create the users table.

4. Create the users table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
email VARCHAR(50),
password VARCHAR(255),
quiz_points INT DEFAULT 1000
);
```

5. Create the category table
```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id        INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username  VARCHAR(50)  NOT NULL,
    name      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY uniq_user_cat (username, name),
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

6. Create the notes table
```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
    id           INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username     VARCHAR(50),
    category_id  INT NULL,
    note         TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (username)    REFERENCES users(username)      ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id)       ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

7. Create the quiz table
```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    note_id INT,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    choice_a TEXT NOT NULL,
    choice_b TEXT NOT NULL,
    choice_c TEXT NOT NULL,
    choice_d TEXT NOT NULL,
    correct_choice CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    difficulty ENUM('easy', 'medium', 'hard') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium',
    FOREIGN KEY (note_id) REFERENCES notes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

8. Create the responses table
```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_responses (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     username VARCHAR(50),
     note_id INT,
     score INT,
     total INT,
     points_earned INT,
     time_taken TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     FOREIGN KEY (note_id) REFERENCES notes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## AI Setup
In backend folder, create a file called 'api_key.php', with the following structure:

```php
<?php
$geminiApiKey = "API_KEY_HERE";
?>
```

We can email you our API key for testing purposes if you do not have one!
